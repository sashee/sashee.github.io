title:  "Timing startups"
---

A few days back I saw an interesting TED talk. The presenter was a man who helped startups
in the early days, and he summarized his experiences. The main idea was that success
was primarily dependent on timing, and not on the idea nor the funding.

It's an interesting finding, as it's something people tend to weight less. Public opinion is
that the idea is key, then the execution, and also some funding certainly helps. But
practice shows otherwise.

It's a funny thing, but it might help to see which companies went bankrupt recently and see whether
their core ideas were any good. There is a good chance their timing was a bit off and redoing their
business hoping the world catched up to the greatness in the meantime. Making these kind of market analyzis is
an interesting concept.
