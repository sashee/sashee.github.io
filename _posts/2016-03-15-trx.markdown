title:  "TRX"

I just went to my very first TRX training, and it was exhausting. But now I know that it works,
it's hard, and there are many variations for the exercises.

Traditional body building requires an awful lot of weights, making it unfeasible to do at home.
Kettlebell only requires one or two moderate weight, which is still more than you would bring
to a vacation.

But TRX makes it to the fullest, as it only requires a special rope. It can be easily carried around.
And you can do a lot of exercises with it. Only find a stable place to fasten it to and you are
good to go.

And the exercises are hard. Even though it's only bodyweight, doing them is exhausting. And in
contrast with traditional body building, there are only a few resting periods.

I'm staying with kettlebells for now, but TRX is a viable alternative for sure.
