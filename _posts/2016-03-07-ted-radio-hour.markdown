title:  "TED radio hour"
---

I like to listen to podcasts during breakfast. It's a habit I put up just recently, but it's much
more refreshing to start a day with interesting ideas than just listening to music.

I was fascinated to see how many podcasts are available. I can scroll down many times to see the end
of the list; evaluating all of them would take a lot of time.

But I'm glad I've found the TED radio hour. It lasts almost an hour and it consists TED talks and
interviews with the speakers. It has a main topic and just a little advertisements. Fortunately there are
many archived casts I can choose from, so I can listen to different interesting topics.

I'll be keeping an eye out for other interesting podcasts. I'm sure there are others out there worth
listening to.
