title:  "Chocolate"
---

I'm eating a lot of chocolate lately. Not as a comfort food, but to provide energy and mental
strength. I even skip the afternoon caffee in favor of it.

I read somewhere that dark chocolate has many of the fatty acids the brain uses. I tried and seems
correct. For years I had a morning and an afternoon caffee and a power nap, and it worked well.
Eating chocolate in addition works even better.

Eating chocolate is generally regarded a fun activity; it is sweet and creamy. But not the darker
variants. They are bitter and not sweet at all; they do not taste that great. I aim for 75% - 85%, what
I can buy.

But they came with increased mental clearness. If I need to concentrate on work or learning, I can do
that more effectively. I still have brain fog, but not that many lately.

This piece of life hacking is working for me so far.
