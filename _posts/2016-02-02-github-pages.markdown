title:  "Github Pages"

Of all the available blog alternatives, I chose Github pages with
Jekyll. Actually I've been thinking about this for some time,
so this decision is well founded.

The majority of alternatives are like Wordpress or Medium; a hosted
service where you
only need to register, making getting started a breeze. My main concern
with them is the content I'm creating is not really mine. Granted, I can
move away any time, but bringing the posts with me is not that easy. Most of
these sites use some kind of rich formatting; it makes copy-pasting
prone to errors.

Also, there are so many options, I can't really pick one over the others.
Maybe Medium seems like the most trending with it's simple interface and
vibrant community, but I might live to rue this decision later.

On the other hand, I already have a blog using Jekyll and I really like
it's simplicity. It's a bunch of Ruby code that takes the posts and
the config files and in turn produces static files; perfect for static
content. Also I got used to writing posts in markdown instead of rich text.
Hosting on Github Pages for free and without hassle is just a bonus
point.

I feel I have complete control. If I ever decide to move away from Github,
then I can set proper redirects to my new site. I can bring my content
with me, wherever I want.

These counterweight the ~5 minutes needed to set up this site. And getting
started is the important thing; perfection will come later.
