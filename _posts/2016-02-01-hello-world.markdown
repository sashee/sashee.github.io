title:  "Hello world!"
---

This is the first post on my new personal blog. I plan it to update every day or so with
topics that generally interests me.

These are mostly related to technology and life hacking; you can expect hard-earned advices and
a somewhat unique view on the world.

I have no fixed goal with this blog, just a place to write every day. I expect that my writing will
improve over time and that I'll find the topics appeal the most to me.

I will do just a little editing, and mostly draft writing. Also I won't track the visitor counts
for the time being; I found that obsessively clicking refresh to see if someone is reading easily
obliterate the original purpose. It does not mean that I won't install an analytics snippet later,
just not from the beginning.
