title:  "Publishing"

Writing only for my own eyes and publishing is a two separate thing. Jeff Goins wrote that
if every piece of writing must be published to count. The moment you show your work to
an audience is an important step. Before that, it's only a draft.

Drafting and editing are two distinct steps. If you don't show your work to others, the editing
part will be missing. You might proofread your writing, but the thrill before clicking the
button simply won't be there.

I write this practice blog to a wide audience. I have no idea why someone would want to
follow and read it as I write, but the possibility is there. I might just delete everything when
I feel I've finished; or maybe I let it stay. Who knows.

But I publish every post I write, no matter how shitty I feel it is. It is a step on the road.
An important step.
