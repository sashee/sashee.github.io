title:  "Programming in everyday language"
---

Programming is a lot like mathematics. Both are quite abstract for most people to grasp the
underlying concepts. Translating them to everyday language is a very hard task, but it would help
many learners.

I saw a video on the Diffie-Hellmann protocol with an explanation using colors. It was so
easy to understand that I only needed to watch it once and I could explain how it works to
others. Videos like this are marbles. They let the audience learn new things with ease. The
protocol works with numbers and large primes and especially the modulo operator
is a hard topic.

It's hard to paraphrase an abstract idea to everyday language, but it's really worth the effort.
If someone is just getting started with programming, then every simplification goes a long way.

My studies were an antipattern to this. The tipical course first introduced a bunch of equations
and variables, then we used them in the whole semester; there were no connection to practical
use cases and that made understanding much harder.

A collections of such tutorials would benefit many. It's often a hard task to create one,
but a comprehensive library would help people see the true nature of programming; it's much easier
than you think.
