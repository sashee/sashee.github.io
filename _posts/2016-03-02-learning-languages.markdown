title:  "Learning languages"
---

I've been learning English intensively for more than 6 months. I memorized words, watched a
handful of videos, read a lot and also aloud. I've done it all by myself. Until now.

There are plenty of resources online that can help to learn languages. Especially English,
there are profuse videos and vocabularies. I bought a few issues of the Economist, then wrote
down any words I didn't know into my paperback notebook. Then I looked up their translations
and a sample sentence for each of them and made some flashcards. Then I read them over and over
again until I felt I know them confidently.

Also I practiced my pronunciation. I watched a few videos on the phonetics alphabet and how to
make the sounds that does not exist in my native language. I started this blog to practice my
writing and become more confident doing it.

And all these worked. I see many serious improvements on my language skills. Compared with
6 months ago, my skills improved immensely. And these could be achieved all by my own without
any formal training or paying for it.

Until now. Hopefully, tomorrow I'll go to a professional English teacher for the first time.
Albeit I improved a lot in many areas, my speaking skills are left out. I expect that with
practice I'll be able to improve significantly; but I can't do that on my own. I need someone
to correct the subtle errors in my pronunciation and to get accustomed to speaking to someone.

I'm a bit nervous right now, but I'm sure it'll be a good decision. I expect it will be hard
and exhausting at first, but I'll get used to it. After a few months, things should be different.
And maybe I'll reach the level I've always wanted.
