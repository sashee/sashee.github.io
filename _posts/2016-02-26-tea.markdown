title:  "Tea"
---

I started drinking tea a few days ago. After my morning coffee, I make an equivalent of ~3 cups
in a pan, and drink it during the morning up until lunch.

There are many kind of ingredients that greatly help to vary each one. These are mostly herbs
that all have some beneficial effects. For now, I aim for ginseng, mate, and lapacho. These all
have stimulative effects, and while I don't expect to experience any big changes for now,
they all should do good.

In the name of life hacking, drinking tea is my latest fad. I'm curious about the effects it
will bring.
