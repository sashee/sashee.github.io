title:  "Opportunities in obstacles"
---

Seeing drawbacks as opportunities is not an easy thing. Most people tend to look at problems as
negative things. They mean unplanned work, and nobody likes working.

But every problem is an opportunity in disguise. If a light goes out in your house, you can buy a
more energy efficient one. If you uncover a bug in the software you are working on, you can make
tests that spot these kinds of problems in the future. If you have problems in your relationship,
they can lead to deep talks and can strengthen the bond.

It's not easy to see things this way. It's often hard to find the upside, and it's certainly requires
more effort. If you are already overburdened, it seems impossible. But doing the small steps to
make things better in your life does make a difference in the long run.

It also makes you happier. You'll see your life getting better, bit by bit. These small steps that
count more than big changes.
